## Zoom etiquette

+ Recording—consent?
+ Have your camera on please
+ If you have a question please speak up
  + If you aren’t confident to interrupt, feel free to put your hand up 
  + Mute in the group sessions, and push space bar to talk 
+ Use Slack chat rather than Zoom chat box
  + Can find stuff later, easier for us to spot
